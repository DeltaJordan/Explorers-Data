Keep it in the Treasure Bag to give its benefit to all of these team members: Happiny, Chansey, and Blissey.  You can get a Lucky Scarf at the Croagunk Swap Shop by swapping: a Chansey Song, a Chansey Card, and a Lucky Charm. That's the easy way!  An item with a ☆☆☆-rarity rating is very hard to get. It's beyond valuable!",
