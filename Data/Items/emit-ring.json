Keep it in the Treasure Bag to give its benefit to all of these team members: Riolu and Lucario.  You can get an Emit Ring at the Croagunk Swap Shop by swapping: a Riolu Tail, a Riolu Card, and a Valiant Rock. That's the easy way!  An item with a ☆☆☆-rarity rating is very hard to get. It's beyond valuable!",
