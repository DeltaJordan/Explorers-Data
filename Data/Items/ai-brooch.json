Keep it in the Treasure Bag to give its benefit to all of these team members: Porygon, Porygon2, and Porygon-Z.  Finding an AI Brooch at the Croagunk Swap Shop is very lucky! Make sure you get it before someone else does! An item with a ☆☆☆-rarity rating is very hard to get. It's beyond valuable!",
